## üöÄ Build and Compile to APK

Follow these instructions to set up the project and compile it into an Android APK file that you can install on your device.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js:** You need Node.js (which includes npm) to install dependencies and run build scripts. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Android Studio:** You need Android Studio to build the native Android app. Download it from the [Android Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio). During installation, make sure you install the **Android SDK** and **Command-line Tools**.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

First, get the code and install all the required packages.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flex-route-optimizer.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd flex-route-optimizer

# Install all project dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Your API Key

This application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. The key must be provided as an environment variable.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
2.  Add your API key to this file:

    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    *Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.* The build process will automatically make this variable available to the application.

### Step 3: Initialize Capacitor

Capacitor is the tool that wraps our web app in a native Android shell.

```bash
# Initialize Capacitor. You will be prompted for an App Name and App ID.
# App Name: Flex Route Optimizer
# App ID: com.flexoptimizer.app (or your own unique ID)
npx cap init

# Add the Android platform to your project
npx cap add android
```
This will create a native `android` folder in your project.

### Step 4: Build the Web App & Sync with Android

Now, we compile the web app and copy the finished files into the native Android project.

```bash
# Build the web app. This creates a 'dist' folder with optimized files.
npm run build

# Sync the web build with the Android project
npx cap sync
```

### Step 5: Build the APK in Android Studio

1.  Open Android Studio.
2.  In the welcome menu, choose **"Open an Existing Project"**.
3.  Navigate to your `flex-route-optimizer` folder and select the `android` directory inside it.
4.  Wait for Android Studio to load and sync the project (this can take a few minutes).
5.  From the top menu bar, go to **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**.
6.  Once the build is complete, a notification will appear in the bottom-right corner. Click **"locate"** to find the generated `app-debug.apk` file.

You can now transfer this APK file to your Android device and install it.
