## üöÄ Getting Started

This application requires an API key from an AI provider to function. Setup is simple and requires no code changes.

### Step 1: Get an API Key

First, you need an API key. Google Gemini is supported out of the box.

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Click on **"Get API key"** and then **"Create API key in new project"**.
4.  Copy the generated API key. Keep it safe.

### Step 2: Local Setup (Desktop)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flex-route-optimizer.git
    cd flex-route-optimizer
    ```

2.  **Run a local server:**
    Since the app uses modern web technologies, you need to serve the files from a local web server. A simple way is to use a VS Code extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or a command-line tool.
    
    Using Python:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    
    Using Node.js (requires the `serve` package):
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    serve .
    ```
    Now, open your browser and navigate to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:3000`).

3.  **Configure the App:**
    -   Once the app loads, click the **Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è)** in the header.
    -   Select your AI Provider (e.g., "Google Gemini").
    -   Paste your API key into the "API Key" field.
    -   The model name (`gemini-2.5-flash`) is pre-filled for Gemini.
    -   Click "Save Settings". The app is now ready to use!

### Step 3: Termux Setup (Android)

Run the optimizer directly on your Android device using Termux.

1.  **Install Termux and Tools:**
    -   Download and install Termux from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).
    -   Open Termux and run:
    ```bash
    pkg update && pkg upgrade
    pkg install nodejs git
    ```

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flex-route-optimizer.git
    cd flex-route-optimizer
    ```

3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
    `serve` will start a web server and give you a local URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Configure and Use the App:**
    -   Open a web browser on your phone (like Chrome or Firefox) and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
    -   Follow **Step 3: Configure the App** from the desktop instructions above to enter your API key in the settings menu.
    -   You can now use the app directly on your device to upload screenshots and optimize routes.
