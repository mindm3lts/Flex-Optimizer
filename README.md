## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this application, you will need a Google Gemini API key.

### Obtaining an API Key

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Click on **"Get API key"** and then **"Create API key in new project"**.
4.  Copy the generated API key. Keep it safe and do not share it publicly.

### Local Setup (Desktop)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flex-route-optimizer.git
    cd flex-route-optimizer
    ```

2.  **Set up the API Key:**
    The application is configured to read the API key from `process.env.API_KEY`. To simulate this in a local environment without a build process, you can add a small script to your `index.html`.

    Open `index.html` and add this script tag inside the `<head>` section, **before** the other scripts:
    ```html
    <script>
      // WARNING: For local development only. Do not commit your API key.
      window.process = {
        env: {
          API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'
        }
      };
    </script>
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.

3.  **Run a local server:**
    Since the app uses ES modules, you need to serve the files from a local web server. A simple way is to use a VS Code extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or run a command-line server.
    
    Using Python:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    
    Using Node.js (requires `serve` package):
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    serve .
    ```
    Now, open your browser and navigate to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:3000`).

### Termux Setup (Android)

Run the optimizer directly on your Android device using Termux.

1.  **Install Termux:**
    Download and install Termux from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).

2.  **Install necessary packages:**
    Open Termux and run:
    ```bash
    pkg update && pkg upgrade
    pkg install nodejs git
    ```

3.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flex-route-optimizer.git
    cd flex-route-optimizer
    ```

4.  **Set up the API Key:**
    As with the local setup, open `index.html` to add your API key. You can use a command-line editor like `nano` or `vim`.
    ```bash
    pkg install nano
    nano index.html 
    ```
    Add the same script block from the local setup instructions into the `<head>` of the HTML file. Save and exit (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

5.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
    `serve` will start a web server and give you a local URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Access the app:**
    Open a web browser on your phone (like Chrome or Firefox) and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You can now use the app directly on your device!
